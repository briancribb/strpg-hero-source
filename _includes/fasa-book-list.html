    <p>The The second edition vastly improved upon the first. FASA filled in the blanks to provide a sensible timeline and a fantastic amount of story pulled from the original series. The Cadet's Orientation Sourcebook is the best source of general information about the setting, with the other two books acting as player and gamemaster manuals.</p>

They're all made to work with Hero Designer v3, so you should be able to just add the packages for race, culture and education before spending your remaining points. You may have to navigate through the folders to load the three prefabs, but after that you should be set.</p>

<h2>Source Books</h2>

<p>The RPG gives a well-rounded view of the Star Trek universe, but these expansions fill in the gaps. They were written by some of the same people who were writing Star Trek novels at the time, so you could just read them as content without worrying about the RPG at all.</p>

<p>These books can be used to flesh out non-player characters, or they can be used to change the setting of the game entirely. If we wanted to, we could play as klingons, romulans, orions or even civilian traders.</p>

<p>Each expansion has its own maps, timelines and world entries. They go far beyond the game mechanics by providing coordinates and information on trade routes. As an added bonus, FASA took great care in keeping the various timelines synchronized. There are a few things that don't quite match, but for the most part it's pretty solid.</p>

  <div class="mb-3 mb-sm-0">
    <h3>The Federation</h3>
    <p>The FASA system provided a better description of the Federation and its history than the TV shows. There's information on Federation planets, procedures, and how all the different cultures mix together. There's also an impressive timeline showing how the founding races developed almost in parallel before encountering each other. No, the Vulcan's didn't explore the entire galaxy alone and then go slumming around our star system. We all did that stuff together, as a group.</p>

    <h3>The Klingons: 2nd Edition</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Starfleet Intelligence Manual</li>
      <li>Game Operations Manual</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is basically a revised version of the 1st edition source book. They separated story from game mechanics to make for a better read, and generally cleaned things up. The Klingons from these books will be the ones we meet in the game, with one exception.</p>
    <p>We're not going to have human/klingon fusions or romulan/klingon fusions. It was an interesting way to explain the lack of head ridges in the original series, but we all know the real reason for that: makeup was expensive. In our game, klingons have always had the head ridges. The Imperial race from this book will be the only klingons we meet.</p>

    <h3>The Romulans</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Starfleet Intelligence Manual</li>
      <li>Game Operations Manual</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So how did the Romulans wind up way across the galaxy before the Federation was formed? The shows, books and games say that the Vulcans have had space travel pretty much forever, but for some reason they didn't advance it for a few thousand years. Then they meet humans and they're ready to innovate again. I've never liked that explanation. It just doesn't fit with the rest of the Federation's story of cooperation and mutual growth.</p>
    <p>But FASA came to the rescue with a fantastic explanation. <strong>The Preservers</strong> did more than just move a few humans around. They saw the Vulcans on their pre-Surak path of self-destruction and took a few to Romulus as a way to preserve the species. These books read almost like a novel, and provide a deep and interesting view of Romulan culture. It was a pretty neat bit of writing when you consider that the authors only had two original series episodes to work from.</p>

    <h3>The Orions: Book of Common Knowledge</h3>
    <p>Following the pattern of the other 2nd Edition source books, this expansion has a player's guide and a gamemaster's guide. This one is for players. It's all the stuff that the player characters might know about the Orions. It covers their history, their culture, and provides some details about those green animal women that we all know and love.</p>

    <h3>Starfleet Intelligence Manual: Agent's Orientation Sourcebook</h3>
    <p>This book is part of a two-book suppliment that covers being a spy for the UFP. This is the player's manual. It's heavy on story and light on game mechanics, so it's a good read even though we're using the Hero system.</p>

    <h3>Trader Captains and Merchant Princes: 2nd Edition</h3>
    <p>This is probably my favorite expansion, because it tells us what happens in the Star Trek universe outside of the various military organizations. It gives us an idea of what those militaries are protecting.</p>
    <p>If we wanted to, we could abandon Starfleet entirely and play our game as a trade ship trying to make a living while avoiding pirates. It's certainly a good source for well-rounded NPC's.</p>

  <div class="mb-3 mb-sm-0">
    <h3>The Triangle</h3>
    <p>No, wait. <strong>This</strong> is my favorite expansion. It's a slice of independent space, surrounded by the three major powers. Pirates, traders, small governments at war, and various factions playing the big boys against each other.</p>
    <p>As an added bonus, much of it is unexplored. Until recent improvements in mining and agricultural technology, this place wasn't worth the trouble for the major governments to move in. It's a setting where everything is accessible, but the unknown is still available. It's most likely where our game will be set.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>These books are more like booklets, really. They were included with adventure modules, but provide some really interesting information about Federation history. These don't have game mechanics... they're all story.</p>

    <h3>The Four Years War</h3>

    <p>This war happened pretty recently, and saw the birth of phasers and photon torpedoes. The Klingons tried to gain a foothold deep in Federation space, and almost managed to keep it. Our game takes place less than a decade from the war's end, so some of the characters might be veterans. This is a must-read for anyone who plans to make such a character.</p>

<h2>Ship Recognition Manuals</h2>
<p>These books have stats and diagrams of military and civilian ships going from the original series all the way to Star Trek III. But there's more to them than that. They also have historical data about when the ships were used and why.</p>

    <h3>Federation Ship Recognition Manual</h3>

    <h3>Romulan Ship Recognition Manual</h3>
    <p>Perhaps the most interesting thing about this book is the information about how Romulan weapons developed, and how late the cloaking device came around. Cloaking devices were special in the Original Series, rather than a standard.</p>
