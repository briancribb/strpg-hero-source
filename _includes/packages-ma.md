	<p>This fighting style requires a bat'leth. These weapons didn't show up until <em>Star Trek: the Next Generation</em> but they're cool and everybody likes them so we needed this package.</p>
	<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
		A bat'leth is mostly a defensive weapon because of the way it's constructed, but it's weilded in an aggressive manner. The wielder can use the force of an opponent's strike to turn the blade around into a serious counter-attack.
	</div>
	<p>In this time period, only Klingons have the opportunity to train with a bat'leth, and actual sword fights are rare. Outside of ritual combat, one Klingon rushing at another with a bat'leth will most likely just get himself shot.</p>
