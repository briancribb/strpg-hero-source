	<p>Phasers are more advanced than lasers, sporting lots of nifty settings. Because they're relatively new at the time of our campaign, they are primarily carried by Starfleet personnel. Black market knock-offs are available in the Triangle, but they're expensive and not quite as good as the official Starfleet model. <em>(For game purposes, knock-off hand phasers won't have the Disintigrate setting and the Stun setting will be one Damage Class lower.)</em></p>
	<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
		Although phasers can be used as weapons of war, they are designed primarily for stunning targets. A phaser set to stun can fire more shots before running out than any other sidearm.
	</div>
	<p>The Phaser II is essentially a supplimentary power pack shaped like a handle, with a Phaser I fitted into it. If necessary, the weapon can be disassembled.</p>

	<p>Next to lasers, The Klingon <strong>Mark 1 Sonic Hand Disruptor</strong> is the most common energy weapon in the Triangle. It's the primary weapon that Klingons sell to other people, keeping the more advanced Mark 2 mostly to themselves. The weapon causes vibration and heat in the target, which could break or melt non-living targets depending upon their construction.</p>
	<p>The <strong>Mark 2 Hand Disruptor</strong> uses focused microwaves instead of sound waves, but the end result of shaking things apart remains the same. This is a more rugged pistol than the Mark 1, and is primarily used by Klingon soldiers. Finding a non-Klingon with a Mark 2 Klingon Disruptor Pistol is as rare in the Triangle as a Federation phaser.</p>
	<p>The <strong>Mark 1 Disruptor Rifle</strong> is a larger version of the Mark 2 pistol, with a larger power pack and more powerful output.</p>
