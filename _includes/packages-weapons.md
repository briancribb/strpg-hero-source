		<p>Lasers are the most common weapon in the Triangle at the time of our campaign, which starts two years after the end of the Four Years War. Their power packs are interchangeable between similar models, but pistols and rifles use different sizes.</p>
		<p>Lasers make neat little holes in a target, so they have no knockback and don't do much STUN damage.</p>

		<p>Phasers are more advanced than lasers, sporting lots of nifty settings. Two things are different from the show, however. I'm nixing the disintegrate setting because it's overpowered, and the overload setting isn't worth messing with the points. I'm just going to wing it depending upon what's left in the power pack.</p>
		<p>Because phasers are relatively new at the time of our campaign, they are primarily carried by Starfleet personnel. Black market knock-offs are available in the Triangle, but they're expensive and not quite as good as the official Starfleet model.</p>
		<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> A Phaser II is essentially a supplimentary power pack shaped like a handle, with a Phaser I fitted into it. If necessary, the weapon can be disassembled.</p>

		<p>Next to lasers, The Klingon Mark I sonic hand disruptor is the most common energy weapon in the Triangle. It's a bit clumsy and difficult to field repair. The Mark I has small field grids on the barrel which can misalign if the weapon is dropped or mishandled, resulting in poor accuracy until repaired. Klingons will sell the Mark I to anyone, so they're easy to find. They're a bit more expensive than lasers, however.</p>
		<p>The Mark I rifle is an improvement upon this design, with a larger power pack and a much sturdier frame. Yes, you can use it as a club without damaging it.</p>
		<p>The Mark II Hand Disruptor uses focused microwaves instead of sound waves, but the end result of shaking things apart remains the same. This is a more rugged pistol than the Mark I, and is primarily used by Klingon soldiers.</p>
