In my travels, I've managed to get almost all of the old books from the [FASA Star Trek Role Playing Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Role_Playing_Game). These books have been out of print for years, and you can only get them by finding someone on eBay who already has one. I'm actaully kind of amazed that I have them all in PDF as well.

I don't want to distribute them to the entire world because they're technically still under copyright. I'll list the books for you though, because if you know what you're looking for then most of this information is out there on the Internet.

I've managed to get almost all of the FASA content on PDF. I'm providing these because they've been out of print for years, and you can only get them by finding someone on eBay who already has one. Just to be safe, these links will only be visible when you're logged into the site. I don't want to just give these things out to the World.

## The Game
Although we will be using the HERO system, much of the content will come from the old FASA game. You really got a sense of your character's career, all the way from the academy to the current post.

It still used random dice rolls, however. A point-based system will provide control for players, but will balance the various races and skills. For example, Vulcan racial modifiers in the Star Trek RPG put them way ahead of everyone else. In the HERO system, they would have to spend points for their powers and advantages.
