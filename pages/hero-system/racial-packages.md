<p class="lead">If you want to be something other than human, then here are some alternatives. Racial and cultural packages are separate, so it’s possible to choose play a catian who was raised on Andor. It’s weird… but it’s possible.</p>

<p>The exception would be Vulcans. It's <em>super-duper-<strong>DUPER</strong> rare</em> for a Vulcan to be raised in another culture and it's probably because they're of mixed ancestry like Spock. Even Spock was raised among Vulcans before flipping off his dad and joining the military, and he still stuck with Vulcan culture.</p>

<p><small><em>* The Cultural Knowledge skills in these packages have a zero cost because they are assumed to be the character’s home culture. Everyone gets their home culture as an Everyman skill.</em></small></p>

The Federation isn't the only power represented in the Triangle. Romulans and Klingons are also around, although Romulans during this time are still mostly unknown to the UFP. Only the Klingons have dealt with them up close, due to their centuries of conflict.
