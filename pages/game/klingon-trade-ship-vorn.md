<p class="lead font-italic">*Edit: The map and information for the ship is directly from the FASA sourcebooks, and is written from the perspective of the Star Trek films. Our campaign takes place before the original series, in the year that this class was introduced. Iâ€™ll most likely adjust that service date by a few years so these vessels can be more common at the time of our story.<br>-BC*</p>

The W-2 Class war-shuttle is used mainly for transporting VIPs within Klingon space, on such interstellar missions as command personnel transfers or espionage insertion missions. You can see the [specifications and deck plans in this PDF]({{site.baseurl}}assets/files/W2_Warpshuttle_Plans.pdf).

## Story Concept for the Trade Ship Vorn

I wanted to make an example crew of supporting characters, so I decided to focus on a small group of Klingons who are exiled from the Empire. Our story is based two years after the Four Years War, so we can take advantage of a failed coup that happened about halfway through it.

During the Four Years War, a Klingon admiral's fleet was driven back by UFP ships equipped with brand new phasers. He blamed the whole thing on insufficient Imperial support and turned his fleet against the Emperor. When it didn't work, he had to run away to the Triangle with his remaining trips. He took two planets and founded the Imperial Klingon States.

Our example crew was on a warpshuttle safely within Klingon space, unknowingly carrying people who were sympathetic to the coup. They took the ship and transmitted their loyalties to the Emperor before the captain and some of the crew took it back. Details are in the character sheets linked below, but the short version is that they were already politically burned and had to run away to the Triangle as well. Once there, the only option left was to start new lives as independent traders. And stay away from the admiral's fleet.

## Low on Crew and Options
There were only three crewmembers left when the Vorn entered the Triangle. Some of the mutineers had smuggled in disruptors and firing inside the ship had damaged some systems. They were desperate for repair parts when they intercepted a partial distress signal from an Orion trade ship under attack by pirates. Gurahn decided to intercept them and ordered an attack after the pirates had boarded.

Attacking by surprise allowed them to overpower a larger ship and take over the whole encounter. The pirates had intended to strand the trade ship without dilithium, so Gurahn stranded the pirates inside their crippled vessel. And in exchange for the "rescue" he asked for spare parts and half of the trade ship's cargo.

One of the Orions volunteered to join them, claiming that she could operate the helm and serve as their cargomaster. They had won the cargo by right of combat, and since the owner of her contract was now dead, they could take her as part of that cargo. The Klingons had no interest in taking on a slave, but she persuaded them to take her, free her and then hire her as part of the crew. It was difficult to built trust at first, but Serana soon became a part of the ship's family. She skims a little, sure, but only after the business turns a profit. They're definitely better off with her around.

		<h3>More About the Map</h3>
		<p>Converting their warpshuttle to a trade ship required making some changes. The crew now stays in the VIP quarters on the port side of the ship, which is the right side of the provided map. Passengers are given the quarters on the starboard side. With only on VIP room left, most passengers will need to use the common heads in the hallway.</p>
		<p>The bunk room has now been cleared and converted into more cargo space, with an additional cargo door added for direct access.</p>
