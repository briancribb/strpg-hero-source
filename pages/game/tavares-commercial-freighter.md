*Edit: The following information is directly from the FASA sourcebooks, and is written from the perspective of the Star Trek films. Our campaign takes place before the original series, in the year that this class was introduced. I’ll most likely adjust that service date by five years so these vessels can be more common at the time of our story.

Designed as a light freighter, the Tavares Class has served Star Fleet for 23 years in that capacity. With a cargo capacity of 45,000 tons, these ships ply the spacelanes carrying out the duties of the Materiel Command. These vessels are not only used by Star Fleet but are also to be found in the civil sector. The 1,226 vessels produced for Star Fleet account for only one-fourth of the total built. These small freighters can usually be seen at any starport throughout the Federation and the Triangle.

The Type O is a research vessel specially built for Star Fleet Intelligence Command. You can see the [specifications and deck plans in this PDF]({{site.baseurl}}assets/files/Tavares_Deck_Plans.pdf).

Though they appear to be identical to visual and casual sensors scan, these ships use a different warp and impulse drive system that allows them to travel at considerably higher warp speeds and gives them a more efficient manuever capability than the standard model. To get this increase in the vessel’s performance, sacrifices were made in the cargo capacity and in some crew comforts.

This model carries a bank of two phasers mounted in the bow and disguised in the forward sensor array; this mounting is so well concealed that it is virtually impossible to detect on a sensor scan unless the weapon is operational. Though considered by some to be ‘a wolf in sheep’s clothing.’ the Tavares is hardly that, considering its weak superstructure and lack of extensive armament.

Of the 1,226 Type II vessels built for Star Fleet,985 remain in active service, while 72 have been scrapped, 122 lost for various reasons, 40 sold to the private sector. The seven that were converted to Type O models remain in operation somewhere.

The Tavares takes its name from a late 20th-century personality responsible for the Terran movement to populate the nearby planets and thus begin their expansion into the galaxy.
