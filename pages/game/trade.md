<p class="lead">Since the story for for this game revolves around trade, we should go over the way that is done in the FASA Star Trek setting. This is mostly for role-playing purposes, but players might enjoy using some of this information to plan out their story.</p>

{% picture assets/img/pages/atlas-cargo-ad.jpg alt="Atlas Cargo Advertisement" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" %}

Much of the information we have about trade is pulled from “Trader Captains and Merchant Princes”, a game supplement which covered civilian traders in a Star Trek setting. It covers lots of possibilities, from merchant academy graduates to criminals to retired Starfleet personnel who wish to start a new career. Rather than make you read all of that, I’ll cover the basics here.

There’s enough detail in the source material to cover as much trade as the players want to get into. *(The game supplement even had rules for the stock market and creating a player-owned corporation!)* However, it can also be used for a bit of background information by players who don’t want to mess with the specific details of cargo sales. We’ll start with the dominant trade union in the UFP and the Triangle.

## Standard Cargo Units

Trading in the FASA setting involves the **Standard Cargo Unit (SCU)**, and **Credits**. The latter is the basic science-fiction style of electronic money, and the former is based upon how FASA used to draw their deck plans. The maps used squares which were 1.5 meters on a side, and a standard deck was presumed to have a ceiling of 3 meters. So a single SCU is 1.5m x 1.5m x 3m, resulting in a volume of 6.75 cubic meters. Volume is the only real concern, since mass can be countered by hand-held antigrav handles and various other devices.

That being said, mass can quickly become a concern if you’re delivering cargo to a place without any of that equipment. You can’t just drop a giant cargo container on a low-tech agricultural world, and you can’t carry vehicles or machinery if your ship is built to transport bulk liquids. Some care is required when making plans.

United Federation of Planets independent Traders Association (UFP/ITA)
This private and independent trade association is licensed by the Starfleet Merchant Marine Command and the Federation Trade Authority to perform many contractual functions for these organizations, including regulation of pay grades for merchant spacehands in UFP space, coordination of testing and certification for interstellar merchants, etc. The organization also maintains a large number of training academies and apprentice programs, and offers placement, guidance and informational services to its millions of members across the Federation and the known galaxy.

Not everyone is a member of the UFP/ITA, but the organization is large enough to have influence which rivals Orion trade families. Because of the UFP/ITA, spacehands and merchants can expect their pay grades to be honored by reputable employers.

## Planetary Trade Profile (PTP)

The Planetary Trade Profile is a code which traders can use to determine the prices for almost any kind of cargo. The letters in the code are a reference to the level of demand for a given cargo on a particular planet. These codes are maintained by the UFP/ITA, and use the format: **DDDDDDD/D (D)**. The first seven cargo types are rated on a scale from “A” (lowest) to “H” (highest) with D in the center as an average. A rating of “H” indicates high demand for a cargo, which would significantly raise it’s selling price. The cargo types are listed below with their base price, as well as the multipliers for the various ratings.

## Luxury Items

The last two letters in the PTP are handled differently, and have their own modifiers. Luxury items (the letter after the slash) are rated on a smaller scale, with “A” as the highest rating and “D as the lowest. A low rating here could mean that the planet in question has plenty of luxury items already, cannot afford them or is culturally disinterested. The luxury rating is the least accurate of them all, because it’s possible to have high demand for luxury items in general, but no interest in the specific items that a trader is trying to sell.

There’s a separate table for luxury multipliers below. You’ll notice that they are randomized, because luxury demand is always changing. Luxury items require less cargo space, but bring more risk.

## Population

The last letter of the PTP (the one in parentheses) is the Population rating for the planet. This rating modifies the Base Consumption Rate for a cargo type, rather than the price. The Consumption rate is a measure of how many Standard Cargo Units (SCU) of a cargo can be sold on a planet before demand drops off.

The Consumption rate is measured from the perspective of a single trader, but if two traders were to arrive at the same place at the same time with the same cargo, it would result in much lower prices as the local area is now flooded with that cargo. (It could also result in a fight.)

## Here’s an Example

Tellar has a Planetary Trade Profile of **EAAGADG/A (A)**. (You can find this information in the FASA suppliment “The Federation”.) The second letter is “A”, which is terrible, meaning that Normal Minerals and Raw Materials will be difficult to sell there. They likely have plenty of raw materials in their system and have no need to have it shipped to them. The base price of 1000 Cr would be multiplied by .25, bringing your base price per SCU down to 250 Cr. Even if you can negotiate, that’s pretty bad.

On the bright side, their rating for High-Technology Manufactured Goods is “G”, which is excellent for a trader. Tellar is a leader on nuclear fusion and matter/antimatter technologies, so there’s a high demand for the equipment required by those industries. The base price for those goods is 500 Cr, which when multiplied by the 1.75 rating modifier, will bring you up to 870 Cr/SCU.

## Pay Grades

Pay grades represent the base pay for a job. Pay grades are officially licensed by the UFP/ITA, so employers sometimes require a certain level for a job opening. A job could require that an applicant is an “Engineer 3”, for example. Pay can certainly be higher than the standard for a job, but cannot be lower.

Independent traders are often low on cash in their first year, so it’s common for a small crew to accept shares of the profits in lieu of part or perhaps all of the normal salary at their pay level. UFP/ITA rules permit this, as long as such crew members are granted a proper lien on the ship to reflect their financial interest. Such arrangements are common on the frontier, especially among traders who have known each other for some time.

## The Tables Below

The rest of this page is just a bunch of reference tables with information on pay grades. Here’s a list of what you’ll find:

<dl>
  <dt>Credits per Month by Pay Grade</dt>
  <dd>Monthly pay for commercial pay grades and for Starfleet, along with a common set of modifiers. Fleet captains are in charge of several vessels, and the Captain’s Purchasing Bonus refers to captains who purchase cargoes. (They’re essentially doing a second job, because this is normally handled by a cargomaster.)</dd>
  <dt>Pay Grade Descriptions</dt>
  <dd>Details for each pay grade. Useful for matching characters up to a job.</dd>
  <dt>Jobs by UFP/ITA Category</dt>
  <dd>The UPF/ITA has official categories for commerce jobs, which are roughly analogous to Starfleet’s militry branches. These tables list the jobs in each category along with their pay grade.</dd>
